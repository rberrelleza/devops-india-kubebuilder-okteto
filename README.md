# Build your first Operator with Kubebuilder and Okteto

This code is part of the talk I gave on how to build operators with Kubebuilder and Okteto, as part of [DevOps India Conference 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBVYE5BgAS4). 

This demo uses the following tech:
- GitHub Codespaces
- Kubebuilder
- Okteto
- Civo
- Go

The included codespace includes everything you need.  You only need to bring your own Kubernetes cluster (I recommend you use [Civo](https://civo.com)) and you'll be ready to roll.
